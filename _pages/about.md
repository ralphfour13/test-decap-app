          We know the challenges of running an Amazon business—because we’ve
          lived them. That’s why we built SellerYard: to give sellers the
          features they’ve always wanted.

          <br/>

          <br/>

          For years, Amazon sellers have relied on software designed by developers who don’t sell on Amazon. We took a different approach. With extensive Amazon selling experience and years of software development expertise, we developed SellerYard—a powerful yet affordable platform tailored to the real needs of arbitrage and wholesale sellers.

          <br/>

          <br/>

          <span style="color:#7C63FD"><strong>Our mission is simple:</strong></span> help Amazon sellers source optimally, restock efficiently, and maximize profitability—without overpaying for warehouse inventory management software.
